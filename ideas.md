- ideas:
  - Highlights of generated output file should be immediately displayed to remove the necessity of leaving the tool in order to analyze output.
  - Tool should analyze active window at startup to generate a variable storing
    the name of the terminal.  This would allow the tool to function properly
outside of gnome-terminal.
[Here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/476641/how-can-i-get-the-name-of-the-current-terminal-from-command-line) is a potentially useful function to accomplish that (though could be optimized).
  - (bugfix not idea) => README file refers to nmap as N-MAP, copy-pasta people
    won't be able to install correctly.
